## Setup an IBM Cloud Account

An IBM Cloud account is required. An Enterprise account is recommended but Pay as you Go account suffices to deploy secure landing zone cloud resources. 

If you do not already have an account, follow instructions [to create the account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#account-gs-createlite) and [upgrade to Pay-as-you-Go](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started#account-gs-upgrade)

- Have access to an [IBM Cloud account](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-account-getting-started). An Enterprise account is recommended but a Pay as you Go account should also work with this automation.

## Setup IBM Cloud Account for Secure Landing Zone

1. Log into IBM Cloud [console](https://cloud.ibm.com) using the IBMid you used to setup the account. This IBMid user is the account __owner__ and has all the IAM accesses.

2. [Complete the company profile and contacts information](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-contact-info) for the account. This is required to stay in compliance with IBM Cloud Financial Service profile.

3. [Enable the flag](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-enabling-fs-validated) to designate your IBM Cloud account to be Financial Services Validated.

4. Enable VRF and Service Endpoints. This requires creating a support case. Follow [instructions](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/account?topic=account-vrf-service-endpoint#vrf) carefully.
