# Dynamic Values

This module compiles various dynamic values for components in `../landing-zone`. These values are compiled here to allow for the unit testing of each of these complex functions only referencing variables.

## Unit Tests


## Variable Notes

Since inputs are all strongly typed, to prevent any issues with adding module and resource values, variables in this module are not typed.
